# Marshmello-LED-Helmet-Code
Code to run an arduino powering a strip of LED's in specific patterns. Right now the patterns are as follows; 4 LED pulses moving along the line randomly coloured, groups of 4 bright blue LED's moving along the line with groups of 4 dimmer LED's everywhere else, then a stream of LED's turning on from the outsides toward the middle and back out again. The code uses random colours and can be adjusted for different numbers of LED's, as well as the number of pulses for the first effect.

The result of the code is shown here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-kyDsXCIX7zaapDqy2qZO9prThYkRj7n
